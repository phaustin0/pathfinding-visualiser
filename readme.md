# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualiser

This application was programmed with Python. If you have not installed Python, install it [here](https://python.org/downloads). Make sure that you have also installed `pip`

This application uses `pygame`. If you do not have it installed, write this command in your terminal emulator:

- If you are on Windows, <br />
` $ pip install -r requirements.txt`

- If you are on Mac/Linux, <br />
` $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Once you have pygame installed, go to the directory where the application is installed, and run `python main.py`.

This project uses the A* Search pathfinding algorithm

After entering the right command, left click on the grid to place the starting tile, ending tile and walls. Right click to remove. Once everything is placed to your liking, press `Space` to start the visualisation process. Afterwards, to clear the screen, press `c`.
